# Waveform

A SwiftUI Package to display an interactive waveform of an audio file.

The project is currently in a very early stage having been created as part of SwiftUI Jam 2021. To include it in your Xcode project click `File | Swift Packages | Add Package Dependencyâ€¦` and enter the following url:

```
https://github.com/pixlwave/Waveform
```

For now, you'll need to select `Branch` and ensure it's set to `main` until v0.1.0 is released.

Code from the end of the Jam will be in the `swiftuijam` branch.
